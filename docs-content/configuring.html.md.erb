## Cassandra Cluster Settings

The product requires an external DataStax Enterprise Cassandra cluster.
The following fields on the configuration page are mandatory:

* IP Address
* Port - you can specify a setting different from the default value of 9042
* Admin username
* Admin password

The admin credentials would be used for managing users in order to bind and unbind CF applications.

## Service plans

The tile requires you to set at least one plan (but allows an arbitrary number beyond that).
You have to set mandatory Name and Description for the plan.
Optionally, a role can be configured for each plan. That role would be assigned to the bound application
credentials. If unset, the credentials would not get any role assigned.

By default all service plans for the service are private. You can check
"Enable global access to plans of service DataStax Enterprise Cassandra for PCF (BETA) Save"
